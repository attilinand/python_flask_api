what is flask?

Why Flask?

Python has a number of web frameworks that can be used to create web apps and APIs. The most well-known is Django, a framework that has a set project structure and which includes many built-in tools. This can save time and effort for experienced programmers, but can be overwhelming. Flask applications tend to be written on a blank canvas, so to speak, and so are more suited to a contained application such as our prototype API.

1)install flask by typing the command pip install flask
2)save this file api.py in any folder.
3)go to that folder path and then type python api.py
4)Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ is the output you will see
5)open browser and http://localhost:5000/ you should see the output
